        <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
        <p>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)[9], often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
        </P>
        <p style="margin-top:45px">
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
